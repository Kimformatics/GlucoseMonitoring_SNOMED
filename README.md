# Title: Mapping Glucose Monitor Data to SNOMED CT Codes 
 
# Introduction:            
Glucose monitoring is a cornerstone of diabetes management, but the true power of this data emerges when mapped to standardized medical coding systems like SNOMED CT. This project demonstrates how to structure, analyze, and map glucose monitor readings using Python and R, making them more interoperable across healthcare systems.

# Project Overview:
I generated a dataset of 100 patients capturing glucose levels, meal status, insulin dosage, exercise levels, and HbA1c percentages. These variables are mapped to SNOMED CT codes, for the purpose of ensuring standardization and facilitating integration into electronic health records (EHRs).

# Key Highlights:
1) Why SNOMED CT? Standardized codes improve interoperability, enabling more effective clinical decision-making.
2) Python & R Implementation: Both languages were used to map glucose-related variables to their corresponding SNOMED CT codes.
3) Applications in Healthcare: Enhanced data integration can support predictive analytics, automated alerts for abnormal glucose trends, and personalized diabetes management.

# Next Steps:
The next phase of this project will focus on integrating this mapped data into visualization dashboards along with the integration with the EPIC EHR via APIs.
